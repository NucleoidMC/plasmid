# Example plasmid worldgen
This part of plasmid contains some commonly shared pieces of worldgen between minigames.
It uses a custom interface to handle world generation instead of using vanilla Features to avoid registration issues.
All of this world generation stuff is optional- You don't have to use it, but it may make your life easier!
